The GeoAI ground-level NO2 estimation challenge will ask participants to develop ML models to estimate surface NO2 concentrations using only public remote sensing data as predictor variables. 
Participants will be provided with ground truth data from air quality monitoring stations and remote sensing data processed by Google Earth Engine (GEE). The challenge encourages participants to explore innovative approaches to NO2 monitoring and modelling, while emphasising simplicity, reproducibility, and transparency in their methodologies. 
Participants will need to test their models not only in general terms, but also spatially over the study area and temporally over the year, and be able to interpret the given results.

The data is:

Ground-truth data from air quality monitoring stations in the continental part of Lombardy and Veneto regions.
Remote sensing data of NO2 from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, precipitation from CHIRPS and land surface temperature from NOAA datasets, all from Google Earth Engine (GEE).
Participants don't have to use all the parameters provided, but are encouraged to create new ones from the existing ones, which could help to improve the performance of the model.
Note: Participants will be provided with two datasets. One for modelling which includes ground-truth and remote sensing data, and the second and the second which includes only remote sensing data and will be used to evaluate the developed model.

Update: Participants are welcome to use elevation data from SRTM and geopy (Python) or elevatr (R) libraries in building their models.
